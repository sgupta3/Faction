# Faction
The aim was to write a custom camera application to take profile/identification photos from an iOS device and have the following features:
-	Only allow one face in the frame. If more, disable the shutter button and show appropriate message.
- The face has to be at a certain distance from the camera to be able to take the photo. Show appropriate messages if the face is too far, too close or at a desired distance.
- Show a face tracker if the face is at a desired distance. 
- To be able to switch the camera if there are 2 on the device.
- To be able to disable/enable flash.
